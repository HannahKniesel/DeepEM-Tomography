# Deep-EM Playground: Bringing Deep Learning to Electron Microscopy Labs

This codebase is part of the Deep-EM Playground. For more details, please see our [webpage](https://viscom-ulm.github.io/DeepEM/).


## 2D to 3D  

### Primary Focus: Tomographic Reconstruction   
### Application: Tomographic Reconstruction of STEM tilt series

#### Challenge: Evaluation with missing ground truth    
#### Required Labels: None

TL;DR ðŸ§¬âœ¨ We use deep learning for tomographic reconstruction of 2D STEM projections, following [1,2]. This approach enables 3D volume reconstruction, revealing detailed cellular structures and relationships not visible in 2D.
